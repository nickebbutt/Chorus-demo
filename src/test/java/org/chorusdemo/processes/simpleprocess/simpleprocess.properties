# Configuration settings for simpleProcess
#
# This configuration starts a Java process which uses the same JVM as the chorus interpreter
# All we need to do is specify the main class
#
# You can also launch native processes using Chorus and change JVM and/or other properties
# See the Chorus wiki for a full list of properties for the processes handler
